        "description": "This means that the heart sound is caused by an abnormal vibration of the heart valves or chambers, which may be due to various conditions such as valve disease, congenital defects, infections, or tumors. The medical advice for this category depends on the type and location of the murmur, as well as the presence of any symptoms or complications.&nbsp;Some possible treatments are medications, surgery, or catheter-based procedures to correct or improve the function of the affected valve or chamber.",
        "advice": "Please consult a doctor for a thorough evaluation of the condition. Additional tests such as echocardiogram or other tests may be required to determine the cause of the problem and direct treatment if necessary."

        "description": "This means that the heart sound is distorted or interfered by external noise sources such as electrical devices, breathing movements, or muscle contractions. The medical advice for this category depends on whether there are any other signs of cardiac problems such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting.

This results in irregular and sudden contractions. While extrasystoles are often minor and not harmful, they can be associated with certain health conditions. Possible causes include heart irritation due to factors like caffeine, smoking, or medications, electrical disorders (arrhythmias) such as ventricular arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, high blood pressure, thyroid disorders like hyperthyroidism, and potassium deficiency (hypokalemia).",
